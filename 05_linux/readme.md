# What is Linux?

**Linux** is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel first released by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, making it a popular choice for servers, desktops, and embedded systems. Linux is used as the core component of many operating systems, known as Linux distributions (distros), which include the kernel along with various applications and utilities. Popular Linux distributions include Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, and Debian.

#### Key Features of Linux:
1. **Open Source**: Linux is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL), allowing anyone to use, modify, and distribute the software.
2. **Security**: Linux is known for its robust security features, including user permissions, encryption, and firewall capabilities.
3. **Flexibility**: It can be used on a wide range of devices from smartphones to supercomputers.
4. **Stability and Performance**: Linux systems are known for their uptime and performance, making them ideal for server environments.
5. **Community Support**: A large community of developers and users contribute to the development and support of Linux.

### Linux Market Share in Cloud Computing

Linux dominates the cloud computing market, primarily due to its open-source nature, stability, security, and flexibility. Most cloud service providers, including AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, offer Linux-based virtual machines and services.

#### Market Share Statistics:
1. **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: Linux instances make up around 92% of AWS's total instances, according to a 2020 report by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
2. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Google reports that over 90% of their cloud infrastructure runs on Linux.
3. **Microsoft Azure**: While traditionally associated with Windows, Azure also supports Linux, and Linux-based instances make up around 60% of its workload, as per a report from 2019.

#### General Cloud Market Share:
- **Linux**: According to a report from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), as of 2020, Linux powers around 90% of all cloud infrastructure.
- **Windows**: Windows instances constitute a smaller portion of the cloud market but still hold a significant share, particularly in enterprises using Microsoft-based solutions.

Linux's dominance in cloud computing is driven by its performance, cost-effectiveness, and the extensive range of open-source tools and applications available for deployment and management.
